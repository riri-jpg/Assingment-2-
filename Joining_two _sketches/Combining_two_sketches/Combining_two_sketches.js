/**
 * Creative Coding 2026 - Week 6: Randomness and Noise
 * made with the help of Karen ann Donnachie
 * 
 * This sketch demonstrates a simple random star field, 
 * where circles of varying sizes and colors are drawn at random positions 
 * on the canvas. The background is faded slightly in each frame 
 * to create a sense of motion and depth, as if the stars are twinkling 
 * or moving through space.
 * 
 * You can experiment with different parameters, 
 * such as the range of randomness, stroke weight, 
 * and background fade to create different visual effects.
 * How would you make specific constellations or patterns of stars?
 * How about adding a shooting star effect?
 * How would you add interactivity, like making the stars respond 
 * to mouse movement or clicks?

  // 1. SET THE STYLING FIRST
  // The golden rule of p5.js: Always set your colors and line thickness *before* drawing the shape.
  stroke(255, 0, 0);   // Make the outline red (Red, Green, Blue)
  strokeWeight(10);    // Make the outline 10 pixels thick

  // 2. CHECK FOR INTERACTION AND SET THE FILL COLOR
  // We use an 'if/else' statement to check a logical condition
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    // If the mouse button IS being held down right now...
    fill(255, 255, 0); // Fill the square with yellow
  } else {
    // If the mouse button is NOT being held down...
    fill(0, 0, 255);   // Fill the square with blue
  }

  // 3. DRAW THE SHAPE
  // Draw the square exactly at the mouse's current X and Y coordinates.
  // It will have a width and height of 60 pixels.
  square(mouseX, mouseY, 60);
